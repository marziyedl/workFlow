# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Solution

For visual representation and steps, I used a stepper. Users can see between steps with the next and back buttons.
For step 6 I used a flowchart, steps on the flowchart are editable with a click on that.
(for using flowchart shapes in this library must buy the pro version so I just change the color).
  
# More feature
I would like to save and update data in browser storage in order to show again on refresh.
Also editing on stepper would be nice.
Stepper in mobile size is not good for this I just add scroll but It can be better.

# Time
I spent around 4:30 :  thinking about solutions,  finding a library , coding ,  automating testing.
